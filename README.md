Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** user stories are complete:

- [x] User sees app icon in home screen and styled launch screen (+1pt)
- [x] User can scroll through a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie DB API (+5pt)
- [x] User can "Pull to refresh" the movie list (+2pt)
- [x] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies to load (+2pt)

The following **stretch** user stories are implemented:

- [x] User sees an alert when there's a networking error (+1pt)
- [ ] User can search for a movie (+3pt)
- [ ] While poster is being fetched, user see's a placeholder image (+1pt)
- [ ] User sees image transition for images coming from network, not when it is loaded from cache (+1pt)
- [ ] Customize the selection effect of the cell (+1pt)
- [ ] For the large poster, load the low resolution image first and then switch to the high resolution image when complete (+2pt)

The following **additional** user stories are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! (+1-3pts)

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. how to implement the searchbar search function
2. how does the constraint work

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

In this assignment, it involves movie API, third party library: Alamofire, and JSON. Although There are tutorial videos to help me to learn it step by step, I still occured a lot of struggle and confused due to the version and set up differences between the video and my xcode. Before I completed this assignment, I already did it over from very begining more than three times, and I got familir with ios coding through this way.
